/*
 * Type of target chip and smart card
 *
 * AVR-based smartcards have the following elements:
 *   1) RAM, ROM (Flash) and internal EEPROM on the processor chip itself.
 *   2) External EEPROM on additional chip (24LC64, 24LC128, 256, 512, 1024).
 *
 * The following data needs to be defined for each chip:
 *
 *  ENDIAN_LITTLE    If architecture is little endian
 *  INT_EEPROM_SIZE  Internal EEPROM size in bytes (0x80=128B, 0x200=512B...)
 *  RAM_SIZE         RAM size in bytes (0x200 = 512 B, 0x400 = 1 KB...)
 *  CHIP             Chip ID, voluntarily assigned by us and returned as
 *                     part of card's ATR signature. Scheme is as follows:
 *                       00: AT90S2323, AT90S2343 (2343 not supported)
 *                       01: AT90S8515, AT90S8535
 *                       02: ATmega161
 *                       03: ATmega163
 *                       10: 16F84 (not supported)
 *                       11: 16F876 (not supported)
 *                       FF: unspec. (running on 386 emulator)
 *  ARCH             Architecture type. Needed for assembler code and returned
 *                     as part of card's ATR signature. (Note that this setting
 *                     is unrelated and different to Makefile's ARCH=).
